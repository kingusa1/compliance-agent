# Live State — Reviewer polish sweep + bulletproof agent-name 2026-05-14 (late)

> ✅ **2026-05-14 (late) — 8 reviewer-facing bugs shipped + Playwright-verified live.**
> Tip commit `8eb9763` (agent-name regex is fallback-only); prior tips:
> `cce70b9` (bulletproof agent-name extraction via regex pre-pass + admin
> backfill endpoint), `1c990e7` (drag-to-scrub on call-detail Waveform
> wrapper), `5749c90` (script-checkpoints UNION across segments + Chat
> "Coming soon"), `2454dae` (LOA router matches script_name when
> lifecycle_phase is NULL), `4c00335` (real speaker names + CheckpointCard
> 2-row header).
>
> Highlights: transcript shows `Afak / AGENT / 0:00` (real analyzer-resolved
> name + role); LOA segments grade against E.ON TPI Verbal LOA Script
> (`875c4a0c`) at `supplier_script_loa` instead of v1_fallback; pre-sales
> 88-rule cards carry their `required` script text; audio bar supports
> drag-to-scrub via Pointer Events + keyboard arrows; Chat tab is gated
> behind a "Coming soon" pill. Agent-name extraction now has a deterministic
> regex pre-pass that catches unusual transliterated names ("Afak", "Parat",
> "Aaqib") the LLM was rejecting as `Unknown`.
>
> Vercel: `dpl_7pvDJnNtCNcaQq1SNqJLuvhVSJVH` (commit `1c990e7`); two
> subsequent backend-only commits did not require a frontend redeploy.
> Backend (Railway): tip `8eb9763`. Both healthy.
>
> Resume guide: [[../04_Sessions/2026-05-14_Session_reviewer_polish]].

> ✅ **Full Phase 5 (a-j) UI overhaul + 4 intelligence endpoints DEPLOYED 2026-05-14.**
> Tip commit `8ccef2b` (intelligence SQL fix), prior tips: `2801fb0`
> (Phase 5 a-i UI + intelligence + SegmentCards), `5de5820`
> (non_compliant_call_v2 test fix — first GREEN CI in 3 pushes),
> `1ae31ee` (6 tests fixed + pipeline excerpt + checkpoint_results),
> `3f222d4` (BRAIN). All 19/19 supplier scripts filled. CI test +
> coverage both GREEN. Frontend `next build` passes locally.
>
> Vercel: `dpl_B5i1YNKkrcJptkiAt8hTL7b59XUz` (commit `2801fb0`).
> Backend (Railway): tip `8ccef2b`. Both healthy.
>
> Reviewer-facing surface is now reduced to 3 verdict buttons
> (Pass / Needs Review / Non-Compliant); coaching + block buckets stay
> server-side. Risk tags only render on non-pass verdicts. AGENT /
> CUSTOMER labels are loud. 1-click pass commits immediately. New
> Intelligence panel on /dashboard shows compliance % by supplier,
> top-10 agents, calls by call_type donut, and 30-day trend. New
> SegmentCards stack on /calls/[id] surfaces per-segment verdicts.
>
> ✅ **2026-05-13 — Backend Phases 0-4 + Phase 5j (upload-boundary fix) DEPLOYED.**
> Tip commit `ddfdb23` (Call.segments + Call.flags relationships fix
> the 500 on upload-response serialization). Prior tips: `796fb62`
> (per-script commit in ingest endpoint), `a0c2da0` (V1 fallback +
> script_id-override + degradation status), `2100fdd` (classifier
> fallback for short transcripts + tests), `8423b64` (Phase 5j route
> + L7Form), `2a2f311` (BRAIN docs).
>
> The AI now auto-classifies recordings into 1-4 segments (lead_gen /
> pre_sales / verbal / loa); each segment grades against its own
> rubric; worst-bucket-wins aggregator emits a single call-level
> verdict. V1 fallback kicks in when no supplier rubric matches.
>
> Vercel: `dpl_29rNSwpsZPQog9JPtymCXETT2VXR` (commit `2100fdd`),
> aliased to `compliance-agent-mu.vercel.app`. (Tip Vercel deploy
> trails by 2 commits — fine since the frontend changes were only in
> 8423b64; later commits are backend-only fixes.)
>
> Phase 0 wipe ran. Supplier-script checkpoints re-ingested via the
> hardened prose-mode extractor: **16/19 Script rows filled (84%)**.
> Three still empty (EDF V11, Pozitive PE, Scottish Power TPI Acq) —
> calls on those suppliers fall through to V1 3-rule TPI fallback
> until reformatting + re-ingest.
>
> User opted out of the full Phase 5 frontend overhaul for now — the
> minimum Phase 5j change to L7Form + intake schema + upload route
> shipped so a live test upload works end-to-end against the new
> backend. Fuller UI overhaul (intelligence dashboard, segment cards,
> double-pill verdicts, agent percentages, HelpBanner removal) is
> queued.
>
> Plan file (approved): `C:\Users\kingu\.claude\plans\magical-booping-crown.md`
> Resume guide: [[../04_Sessions/2026-05-12_Session_taxonomy_rebuild]]
>
> Earlier 2026-05-11: shipped color-coded 3-vs-4 stage `WorkflowTypePill`
> on `/customers`, `/customers/[slug]`, `/calls/[id]`. Pill is auto-derived
> from the AI-detected supplier label — emerald `3-stage · LOA bundled`
> for E.ON variants, blue `4-stage · separate LOA` for everyone else.
> Aly ask drafted at `comms/2026-05-11_Aly_ask.md` (4 blockers consolidated).
> Playwright-verified on prod (`dpl_HzAFRTJoxPuBi4T96V3jLLqKDQQt`).
>
> Earlier 2026-05-10 late: 5 bugs + 5 UX fixes shipped after a full
> Playwright-driven sweep. Live test login created; ground-truth upload
> validated (Bonnie Clarke = first 3/3 compliant call in DB).

> See [[../04_Sessions/2026-05-11_Session_workflow_pill]] for the full punch list.

## Frontend (Vercel)
- **Alias:** `compliance-agent-mu.vercel.app`
- **Current Vercel deploy:** `dpl_29rNSwpsZPQog9JPtymCXETT2VXR` on commit `2100fdd` (Phase 5j L7Form fix). Subsequent backend-only fixes did not require a Vercel re-deploy.
- **Project rootDirectory:** `frontend-v3` ✓
- **Project framework:** `nextjs` ✓
- **Auto-deploy:** **NOT wired** — `link.deployHooks: []` on the Vercel project. Pushes to `main` do not trigger Vercel. Trigger via API POST `v13/deployments` with `gitSource={type:github,repoId:1233382040,ref:main,sha:<HEAD>}`. CLI token at `$APPDATA/com.vercel.cli/Data/auth.json`.
- **All routes 200/307** (verified 2026-05-13): root redirect, login, dashboard, queue, calls, tracker, customers, customers/<slug>, deals, rejections, scripts, agents, compliant, non-compliant, observability, guide, settings.
- ⚠️ **Auth-gate caveat (unchanged):** anonymous GET on protected routes renders the Sign-In form, not the page content. Use the test login below to see real pages.

## Backend (Railway)
- **URL:** `https://compliance-agent-production-690e.up.railway.app`

## (legacy snapshot below — pre-audit-late)

## Database state (post 2026-05-10 audit)
- **Customers:** 5 visible
  - `dorothy's evangelical church` — 3 calls, 1 deal, suppliers `[E.ON Next]` (Quality Agent merge result)
  - `crosby garage` — 1 call, 1 deal, suppliers `[E.ON Next]`
  - `korner kutz (audit upload)` — 1 call, 1 deal, suppliers `[E.ON Next]` (added 2026-05-10 audit)
  - `(auto-detect pending 42a89a59)` — **0 calls** (call was deleted), 1 orphan deal stub (delete endpoint doesn't cascade up)
  - `(pending audio upload)` — 0 calls, 1 stub deal
- **Calls:** 5 total — all `completed`. Failed `42a89a59` was deleted in the audit. Audit's own `190868a8-…` could NOT be deleted (HTTP 500 — see Known_Issues "DELETE on completed calls").
- **Deals:** 5 total
- **Scripts:** 15 active (E.ON × 5, Scottish Power × 3, BG × 2, BGL × 2, EDF × 2, Pozitive × 1)

## Auto-running agents
- **Quality Agent** auto-runs on every upload via `pipeline._step_finalize → auto_resolve_for_call`
- Per-checkpoint analyzer always runs in `_step_analyze_checkpoints`
- Vulnerability detector runs in `_step_finalize`
- Pricing-mismatch flags run in `_step_finalize` when feature flag is on

## What shipped 2026-05-10 (evening — fixes pass)

Backend (Railway, deployed via GitHub auto-deploy on push to `main`):
- `CallSummary.reason` field added → /non-compliant table now shows AI reason instead of "—"
- `/api/calls/{id}/script-checkpoints` falls back to V1 TPI rules when matched script has empty `checkpoints` (which is true for ALL 15 seeded scripts) — stops `(Script text unavailable …)` empty state

Frontend (Vercel, deployed via API trigger to `prj_eHIyIFyxusNdCd6mR9Ff469NrcKO`, deploy id `dpl_tqUvcoWHP5toL9p9TMRGCiC7qPjv`):
- `/calls` trash icon always visible (was hidden behind `group-hover:visible`)
- Claim/Unclaim workflow removed from UI:
  - `/queue` filter chips simplified to All / Pending / Reviewed (was: All / Unclaimed / In review / Reviewed today)
  - `/queue` CTA changed from "Claim & review" to plain "Open & review" link
  - `useClaimCall` hook no longer imported by any UI (kept in lib for legacy)
  - `CallPreviewPanel` (used by /non-compliant rail) — status pill collapses unclaimed + in_review to "Pending"
  - `QueueDetailPanel` — same pill simplification + Open & review CTA
  - Dashboard description updated
